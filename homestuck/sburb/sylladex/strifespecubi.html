<p>strife specubi are handy for freeing up sylladex cards, while also allowing you to quickly grab weapons!
<br>to use your strife specibus, you need to allocate it to a specific kind of weapon.

<p>you may only allocate one type of abstratus to your strife specibus... but you can get used specubi to add to your strife portfolio by killing things! wonk

<p>you can have multiple weapons in your strife specibus at once! i'm 85% sure you can do so without using up a sylladex card. pg 167 and 38 are giving me conflicting information, though
<br><br>if a weapon in your specibus breaks, the abstratus will break with it. reparing the item while it is inside the specibus will repair the abstratus though!

<!--
strife specubi can only have one allocated weaponkind, and the allocated weaponkind is permanant. it does free up a card of sylladex use, though...
you have to find multiple specubi cards to have multiple weapons in your strife specubi! (pg 167)
strife specubi may be broken if you weapon is damaged. if you repair an item that is in your broken specubi, the card will revert to the fixed version! (pg 410)
