<h2>-- overview --</h2>
<p>sylladexes are decks of cards that you can put items in! typically, they are used for carrying items. like instead of people using their pockets, they just captchalouge everything. it's neat!
<br>you can put any objects into capchalog cards, and can carry even the heavyest of things :D </p>

<p>you can even captchalouge living beings!</p>

<p>unfortunatly, there <i>is</i> a hard limit to how big of an object you can store in your dex</p>

<br>(pg 68)
<br><hstxt>You can carry hefty items, but that thing is just way too big. Get real!</hstxt>
<br>
<p>moduses define how your sylladex works. if you have a tree modus, it'll act like a file tree! if you have a queue modus, you will only be able to take out the oldest card put in
<br>if you have multiple modeses, you can switch between them at any time! 
</p>

<p>you can also combine items that are on multiple cards to one card!
</p>

<p>if there are cards inbetween the two cards you want to stack though, they will all be merged</p>

<p>as long as the items in your stacked card aren't a mess, you can take out and put individual items in the card!</p>

<p>to add more cards to your sylladex, you need to first captchalouge the cards, then get your sylladex to expel the cards. instead of actually expelling the card though, it will be added to your deck! :D
</p>

<p>you can wear items in you sylladex, too.
<br>wearing an item will free up the cards surrounding said item for use! the card with the item is in use though, and is not free for other objects
</p>
<img src=/homestuck/old/hscrop/wearables.gif>
<img src=/homestuck/old/hscrop/wearablecardscantbeused.gif>
<p>you can add items to your wearables when in use, though! just make sure you can wear it
</p>
<img src=/homestuck/old/hscrop/lessfunny.gif>
<p>wearable items can also act as defense, such as armor in doom. they stack on top of your health vial i assume...
</p>
<img src=/homestuck/old/hscrop/begalaegis.gif>
<p>there's an interesting way to "weaponize" your sylladex. having cards eject from your modus as you try to pick up too many objects can fling the items out! sometimes at way too fast speeds</p>
<img src=/homestuck/old/hscrop/dudedodge.gif>
<p>and sometimes way too slow speeds</p>
