<h3>-- various fun facts --</h3>

<h3>-- jackspers noirlecrow --</h3>
<p>during the flash on page 1668, jack just. kills the black queen, using the weapon in the package jade meant to send to john.</p>
<img src=https://i.imgur.com/ORK6b88.gif>
<p>he then takes her four orbed ring, which gives carapacians the same powers that the underlings have from prototypings! this results in him becoming the best villain in homestuck, "Jackspers Noirlecrow"</p>
<img src=https://i.imgur.com/MChgYH8.gif>
<p>after he gains the manpower of underlings, he takes to the battlefield so that he can finish the war between derse and prospit himself</p>

<p>after accomplishing the goal of the dersites (i.e., causing the reckoning), he just. snaps and kills all of the remaining carapacians.</p>
