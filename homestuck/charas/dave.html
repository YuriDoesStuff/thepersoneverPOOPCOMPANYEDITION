<p>dave strider (turntechGodhead) is the third character introduced in homestuck. in the medium, they are known by myth as the prince of time.
<br>he lives in an apartment within texas with his brother, who is. just textbook abusive. 
<br>he is the third person to enter the medium! his planet is the land of heat and clockwork, and his sprite is davesprite... due to doomed timeline shenanigans. thank god for unstable loops not mattering if you come from a diffrent timeline &lt;3
<br>dave uses the hashmap array modus, and has allocated his first strife specubi card to bladekind before we even see him. his main instrument is/are turntables...
<br>his introduction via pesterchum was on page 26, which is also the first pesterchum interaction we see. it's about piss
<br>he was first seen on page 309! hashtag oh snap

<p>dave's the greatest thing to "irony" since... im not sure transmeds</p>
<img src=/homestuck/hscrop/ironygod.gif>
<p>dave enjoys rapping! he does so several times throughout the mspa</p>

<h3>-- his brother. --</h3>
<p>dave's brother kinda sucks! he leaves weapons everywhere</p>
<img src=/homestuck/hscrop/swords.gif>
<p>leaves "smuppets" everywhere</p>
<img src=/homestuck/images/flipout.gif>
<p>and just beats him up for like 3 flashes oh my god</p>
<img src=/homestuck/hscrop/beatdownaftermath.gif>
<br>
<p><small>also he uses "complete bullshit" as a browser and has a surreal sense of humor but this section is more about how his brother is a horrible caretaker and using a browser called complete bullshit isn't really abusive so uh</small>

<h3>-- dave's dream writing --</h3>
<p>on pg 1643, rose (from a doomed timeline) says this: 
<br><br><hstxt><font color=#b536da>TT: If my past self can wake up sooner, maybe I'll be the one to visit you first this time.
<br>TT: I'll fly by and remind you you're already awake and don't know it.</font>
</hstxt>
<br><br>this implies that dave has been awake on derse for awhile and just hasn't realized it... which i assume to also mean that dave has had his perception on <i>something</i> changed, but that he didn't realize that his dream self had woken up. (...if only talking about what we see in story, my best guess for when this would have happened is around pg 465.)
</p>
<img src=/homestuck/hscrop/flipoutcalrealization.gif>
<p>also... writing was visible on the walls of dave's room in derse, which implies that he's able to see it.</p>
