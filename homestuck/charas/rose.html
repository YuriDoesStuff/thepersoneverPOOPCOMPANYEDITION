<p>rose lalonde (or tentacleTherapist) is the second character we are properly introduced to! she's known via myth as the seer of light, and she also stole my name!!!! :(
<br>rose lives in a house in the woods close to a laboratory. her gaurdian is her mother, who is an alcoholic. and not a great mother
<br>she's the second to enter the medium! her planet is the land of light and rain, and her sprite is jaspersprite!!!
<br>rose uses the tree modus for her sylladex, and allocates her first strife specubi card to needlekind. her main instrument is the viola
<br>her introduction via pesterchum was on page 63, but the first time she is properly introduced was on page 214!</p>

<h3>-- rose's dream writing --</h3>
<p>one day during mock therapy, jaspers (her cat) told her an absolutely insane SECRET. unfortunately, before she could ask him more questions, he DISAPEARIFIED!</p>
<img src=/homestuck/hscrop/jaspersdisapearify.gif>
<p>this drove rose to do similar things to what john had done, however instead of drawing clowns... she just wrote meow a lot</p>
<img src=/homestuck/hscrop/rosehousemeow.gif>
<br><br><img src=/homestuck/hscrop/rosebookmeow.gif>
<br><br><img src=/homestuck/hscrop/jackascendrosemeow.png>
<p>once rose enters the medium and finds time to talk with jaspersprite, she interrogates jaspersprite about the secret. however, all jaspersprite has to say about the secret is</p>
<img src=/homestuck/hscrop/jaspersprite.gif>
<br><br><hstxt style="color: #f141ef">JASPERSPRITE: Meow.</hstxt>
<p>this changes rose's perspective on the cat's secret... what she thought was a mysterious secrety secret turned out to not actually be all that secretive. this, combined with Future Dream Rose merging with her past self's dreamself allows her to figure out a genetic code from the meows!</p>
