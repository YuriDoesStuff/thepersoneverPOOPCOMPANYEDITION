<p>an <i><strong>msp</strong></i>aint <i><strong>a</strong></i>dventure is a story through images on the internet, with each page having a correlated command and response (ala old adventure games)
<br>that's it really! </p>

<p>in all actuality, mspas can be much more than images on a screen. there's many tropes specifically tied to mspas (usually originating from andrew hussie's work, due to the fact hussie founded mspas as a whole), but this page will primarily focus on the technology behind mspas</p>
<p>initially, the first few mspas were exactly what i described before... mock games in a "choose your own adventure" style with images. but with the third mspa hussie put out, the images began to <i>move</i></p>
<img src=images/mechanicalbull.gif>
<p>hussie used photoshop to animate all panels seen in problem sleuth, for both visual effects (such as mobster kingpin's eyes here)</p>
<img src=images/eyeboy.gif>
<p>and for more traditional animation</p>
<img src=images/psdance.gif>
<p>another thing to note is that, opposed to previous mspas hussie made, problem sleuth reused a lot of art to help speed up panel output. the reuse of assets also gave the mspa a sprite-based look, which further tied mspas to mock games.</p>
<img src=images/reusedsprites.gif>
<p>not all panels reused art though!</p>
<img src=images/Thisisincrediblysilly!.gif>
<p>typically, hand drawn panels were made to move the camera for either dramatic or comedic effect. or hell sometimes both</p>
<img src=images/wilfordbrimley.gif>
<p>however, with <glorg title="this is just me speculating this might be completely wrong">flash being a better software for both animation and reusing assets, hussie decided to go with adobe flash for his next mspaint adventure!</glorg></p>

<br>
<br>wait
<br>
<iframe src="flash?f=images/smoothjohn2.swf" style='border: none; background-color: transparent; aspect-ratio: 11/8; width: 80%; overflow: hide;' allowtransparency='true'></iframe>
<p>why is it smooth<p>
<img src=images/endofsmooth.png>
<p>ok good nevermind
<br>after a short stint with 8 completely interactive panels made entirely in flash, hussie went back to drawing all assets in photoshop. some panels were still animated in photoshop (note the low framerate),</p>
<img src=images/lowframerate.gif>
<p>while i'm convinced others were made in flash</p>

<img src=images/flipout.gif>
<p>homestuck also used flash-formated files (swfs) in several panels! they're used in everything gif exports couldn't handle, such as more advanced effects,</p>
<iframe src="flash?f=images/pcenamel.swf" style='border: none; background-color: transparent; aspect-ratio: 11/8; width: 80%; overflow: hide;' allowtransparency='true'></iframe>
<p>silly little interactive things,</p>
<img src=images/interactive.png>
<p>little animations with audio,</p>
<img src=images/skiesofskaia.png>
<p>and full ass music videos and playable games</p>
<img src=images/jackascend.png>
<img src=images/lowas.png>
<p>as homestuck moved forward, flashes came along that further pushed the envelope. mentioning them at all would really, really suck for literally anyone reading this that hasn't finished homestuck so. just think EOA5 and caliborn's site wrecking mischief for now</p>
