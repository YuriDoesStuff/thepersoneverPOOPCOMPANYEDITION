[Verse 1]
Would you like to go deep inside the Crisis Actors studio?
Would you like to see all the things they never show you on TV?

[Refrain 1]
Your baby's alive (Your baby's alive)
Your family's fine (Your family's fine)
Imagine a time (Imagine a time)
When dinosaurs ruled the earth
We can rule the earth

[Verse 2]
They've been leaving clues; unobtrusive twenty-threes and fourty-twos
Those who do the math have been known to end up drowning in the bath

[Refrain 2]
The names are made up (The names are made up)
The problems are real (The problems are real)
The future was sealed (The future was sealed)
When dinosaurs ruled the Earth
We can rule the Earth

[Guitar Solo]

[Outro]
Malevolent gods (Malevolent gods)
Are better than none (Are better than none)
Malevolent gods (Malevolent gods)
Are better than none (Are better than none)
Malevolent gods (Malevolent gods)
Are better than none (Are better than none)
Malevolent gods (Malevolent gods)
Are better than none (Are better than none)
Malevolent gods (Malevolent gods)
Are better than none (Are better than none)
The damage is done (the damage is done)
oh no
