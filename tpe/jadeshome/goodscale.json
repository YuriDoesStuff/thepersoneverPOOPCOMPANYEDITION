				"description":"the best 2d pikmin game<br>this is one of the first games we really... got into! this (and adventure time HEY ICE KING!!! STOP TOUCHING MY TRASH) were some of the first ds games we picked out for ourselves<br>looking back, i can draw quite a lot of paralels from this to pikmin! the fact that you gain more kirbys from defeated enemies, the treasure trove of collectables, and the obvious one - the fact that you have like 243 kirbys - really brings the title to feel like a \"pikmin-like\". i'd say it feels more pikmin then even hey pikmin!<br><br>the music in this game stands out to me a lot :D<br>though a lot of tracks in this game are used multiple times, each track feels very different! the music in mass attack blends typical bit-crushed roland samples with more synthy instruments, leading each song to stand out among what you would usually hear on the ds<br>i also really enjoy the combat in this game. though it may be relatively simple, i think that the fact that it's very frantic and usually punishes careless players lends itself to feel a lot deeper than it is at first glance. the way you fling kirbys also really reminds me of aiming in the non-switch pikmin games a lot, which i prefer more to the automated systems in pikmin 3 deluxe and pikmin 4<br>one of the main reasons mass attack is rated so high is due to its significance to us. i'm like 90% sure it was our first kirby game, after finding out about kirby through smash! ever since we started playing him, we really REALLY wanted to get our hands on one of his games. so, um. we eventually aqquired it! how we exactly did escapes me, however :("

				"description":"an incredibly human game <br> night in the woods touches so many themes and topics, while having wonderfully constructed characters that just. feel like real people <br> so much love and care was put into this game and you can really tell... from the more impactful conversations to just the lighthearted chatter, all the characters display a very prominent personality :D <br> everyone reacts to story events in an incredibly believable way, no matter how small their role is, and i really enjoy both its comedy and how it addresses its more serious topics"},

				"description":"a wonderful exploration of the web's capabilities for storytelling <br>homestuck, typically described as a \"webcomic\", is really nothing like a webcomic <br>all mspaint adventures (the series/medium homestuck belongs to) follow the same format: each webpage has its own unique panel and paragraph. sometimes, text may be absent to lend more focus to the panel, but pages like that are usually far between each other. <br>homestuck of course follows this format, but it also bends it. some pages have flash animations, interactive games, multiple panels, or panels that stretch out of the typical bounds of a panel for impact. sometimes, the entire theming of a webpage is changed to give viewers a sense that Shit is Happening!! the way homestuck deconstructs typical media, be it web content or general writing tropes, is incredible <br>speaking of writing, homestuck also has incredible literary content. characters react in believeable ways, and are all incredibly distinctive. while a few characters are pushed to the side shortly after being introduced, much of the cast is still incredibly fleshed out - to the point that there's very few characters that feel like \"side characters\". though it takes a while to get through every character's introductions, when shit starts happening it happens FAST. homestuck is a joy to read through, and can be analized to hell and back due to its over 8000 webpages"
