				<h1>about :o</h1>
				<p>this is a page dedicated to my WIFE!!! (also partner system in general)
				<br>i started work on it on our first anniversary, because my heart was just so Full Of Love that i needed to get it out somehow!!
				<br>i met our partner system's nepeta mid 2024 on twitter, and messaged her on discord! and i didn't really stop messaging and we just ended up snogging each other eventually 
				<br>our partner system is actually pretty nice in general and we both love talking to whoever's fronting at any moment :3 or at least i know we do... they just give us a very warm feeling usually and make us feel very safe
				<br><h2><i>love u starbursts&milk!! &lt;3</i></h2>
