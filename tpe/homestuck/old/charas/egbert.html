<p>john egbert (or ectoBiologist) is the first character introduced in homestuck! oh boy! in the medium, they are known by myth as the heir of breath
<br>they live with their dad in a suburb, and are the first in their session to enter the medium. their planet is the land of wind and shade, and their sprite is nannaquinn! 
<br>they have stack, quene, and array modi, and have allocated their original strife specubi to hammerkind. their main instrument is the piano

<h3>-- various fun facts --</h3>

<p>john uses pesterchum 6.0, which is avalable on the windows-xp lookalike that john uses, and PDAs.</p>
<img src=/homestuck/old/hscrop/pesterchum6.0.gif width=300px><img src=/homestuck/old/hscrop/6.0pda.gif width=300px>
<p>they also love "horrible movies". how do you feel about con-air?
<br>john has a peanut allergy, too.
<br>did you know they use the typheus browser?</p>
<img src=/homestuck/old/images/typheus.png> 
<br>wait oh my god is this foreshadowing (OoO) [gasping face]
<br><p>they also own a copy of the worst thing known to man.

<p>"Each GAMEBRO MAGAZINE is guaranteed to be printed on 40% recycled asbestos. For big ups to Mother Earth, yo."
<br><br>their dad also has had a restraining order filed against him

<h3>-- john's bedroom writing --</h3>
<p>on page 1003, john talks to rose about what they thought was the imp's doing to their posters. however, rose states that the posters had writing on them before they even entered the medium</p>
<img src=/homestuck/old/hscrop/johnposters1.gif>
<br>
<br><hstxt><font color=#0715cd>EB: serves them right for ruining my posters. the bastards.</font>
<br><font color=#b536da>TT: Which posters?</font>
<br><font color=#0715cd>EB: don't you see? my sweet movie posters. look at them, they're fucking ruined.</font>
<br><font color=#b536da>TT: John.</font>
<br><font color=#0715cd>EB: ??????</font>
<br><font color=#b536da>TT: Are you suggesting that imps are responsible for defacing your movie posters?</font>
<br><font color=#0715cd>EB: uh, YEAH?</font>
<br><font color=#b536da>TT: Your posters have looked like that ever since I first saw your room.</font>
</hstxt>
<p>rose provides several screenshots that were taken before john had entered the medium, to try and prove to john that the drawings were made by them</p>
<br><a href=https://www.homestuck.com/images/storyfiles/hs2/walkthrough/screencaps/7.jpg target=_blank><img src=/homestuck/old/hscrop/7.jpg></a>
<p>apparently, as stated by hussie on page 1674, john had actually drawn on their walls while they were sleepwalking... this is also why there's writing on the walls of most of the kids' dream bedrooms!</p>
<img src=/homestuck/old/hscrop/prospitjohnwriting.gif>
<p>the reason john was able to see the drawings after exiting their dad's room is because finding out that their dad didn't actually like clowns changed their perspective on. something, and thus their subconcious allowed them to finally see the drawings in their bedroom
<br><br>i assume that john had wondered why their dad was so into clowns that they drew on the walls in their sleep... finding out that their dad wasn't really into clowns changed their perspective on him, and the clowns in their house in general. the clowns that his dad put up must seem less antagonistic than before... like john's dad tried to put them up to try and connect with john in some way? blegh</p>

<h3>-- the land of wind and shade --</h3>
<p>LOWAS is the planet that john is sent to once he enters the medium. it has a very blue color scheme, and has many yellow salamanders inhabiting its surface!</p> 
<img src=/homestuck/old/hscrop/lowasdescriptor.png>
<p>there are also a lot of parcel pyxis! they are all connected via tubes, and are kinda like gift exchanges</p>
<img src=/homestuck/old/hscrop/parcelpyxis.png>
<p>if you find a carved tablet, you should put the item carved on it in the pyxis. if you find an item in the pyxis, you get to keep it!! it's cool :D</p>

<p><a>-- > [S] ACT 4 ==> --</a></p>
<p>act 4 ==> is the introduction to lowas. it is also the first playable flash where you can fight things!</p>
<img src=https://imgur.com/fUUOZMI.gif>
<p>if you wanna really play it well, you should probably zoom out... you'll be able to see more, and the game will run a bit better</p>

<p>the mangrit charge isn't very useful in my opinon... it takes forever to charge, and is hard to hit enemies with. and the damage it does deal is less than two dual hammer swings, which only takes a fraction of the time to execute. sigh...</p>

<h3>-- ectobiology stuff --</h3>
<p>ectobiology is the practice of creating exact paradox clones via the paradox ghost imprints made by trying to dissapearify things that are essential to the timeline. that's already a mouthful hold on
<br><br>on page 927, rose encounters an appearifyer</p>
<img src=/homestuck/old/hscrop/rosewithappearifyer.gif>
<p>she attempts to appearify jaspers, who was about to tell her a secret. this secret is pivotal later on in her life, and thus him not being able to tell her this secret would create a paradox</p>
<img src=/homestuck/old/hscrop/paradoxify.gif>
<p>to prevent this paradox from happening, the machine simply creates a paradox ghost imprint of jaspers!</p>
<img src=/homestuck/old/hscrop/paradoxghostimprintjaspers.gif>
<p>this imprint can then be sucked up by a paradox cloning machine, which can then create a paradox clone of the imprint's subject</p>
<img src=/homestuck/old/hscrop/paradoxclonersuckup.gif>
<br><br><img src=/homestuck/old/hscrop/paradoxclonermutant.gif>
<p>unfortunatly, the previous operator of rose's paradox cloner was unable to perfect the science of ectobiology... such that the paradox clone of jaspers exibits mutliple mutations.</p>
<p>john encounters a similar setup on the veil, around pages 1767 and 1865</p>
<img src=/homestuck/old/hscrop/johnwithappearifyer.gif>
<p>they are able to create perfect paradox clones of their grandma, rose's mom, dave's brother, and jade's grandpa</p>
<img src=/homestuck/old/hscrop/alphababiesappear.gif>
<p>this particular ectobiology setup is also able to create the offspring of any two paradox clones created</p>
<img src=/homestuck/old/hscrop/ectobiologyjohndump.gif>
<p>as such, this means john and jade were born from grandpa harley and grandma egbert's dna, while dave and rose were created from bro strider and mom lalonde's dna</p>
<img src=/homestuck/old/hscrop/betakidsappear.gif>
<p>i have no idea where this puts john's dad</p>
<img src=/homestuck/old/hscrop/dadegbertonjackscreen.gif>
<p>on page 1903, karkat explains that if a paradox clone is perfect, then it will go back in time to become the target</p>
<img src=/homestuck/old/hscrop/ectobiologyjohnpesterkarkat.gif>

<br><hstxt><font style="color: #626262">CG: A PARADOX CLONE IS BY DEFINITION A CORRECTLY CLONED DUPLICATE THAT WILL INEVITABLY GO BACK IN TIME AND BECOME THE ORIGINAL TARGET THAT WAS CLONED.
<br>CG: IF IT'S A MALFORMED CLONE, IT'S JUST A MEANINGLESS MUTANT THAT HAS NO BEARING ON THE STABLE LOOP CONTINUUM.</font></hstxt>
