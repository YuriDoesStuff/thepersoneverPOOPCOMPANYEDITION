<h3>LOFAF <a href=charas/jade target=_blank>(land of frost and frogs)</a> is a fansite created by <a href=/ target=_blank>thepersonever</a> with the goal of converging general information about the characters, locations, and mechanics of homestuck's universe as a personal project!</h3>
<p>if i can do anything for the homestuck community, it's going to be making a silly personal fansite with trivia and obvious mechanics of sburb that may or may not be helpful with making fan adventures, or helpful with just generally understanding homestuck better. so, early 2024 i started work on this fansite, lofaf! 
<br><br>mspaint adventures are very much tied to where i am now, even if it's not the reason i picked up web design. i initially started working with html after reading a blog post on tumblr, and was thus introduced to the concept of the indie web! in such, i found other websites mentioning homestuck, so i started exploring some of the many works of andrew hussie
<br>at the time, i was embarrassed. furry turned homestuckie??? get a load of this nerd!!!! ...over time though, i warmed up to displaying my affection to hussie's works publicly. no time like the present to flip off cringe culture!
<br>making a twitter account to talk to other homestuck fans easily is what i think prompted this... though, i'd recommend joining homestuck twitter about as much as i'd recommend joining any other subtwt. which is to say, i don't recommend joining twitter at all!!</p>
<p>due to homestuck being this hugeass <i>thing</i>, and the fact that it implements more game mechanics than any other of hussie's mspas, i'd say homestuck is my favorite mspaint adventure. problem sleuth was also a blast though, and i thought jailbreak was pretty fun!! bardquest is impossibly idiotic and thats what makes it special &lt;3 
<br>i think psycholonials is currently the best literary work hussie has made, due to it being more planned out... i have yet to read hussie's pre-mspa stuff though, so keep that in mind for these opinions :p</p>
