<p><span>hi! i'm jade <!-- I'M FREE. I DONT CARE ANYMORE EVERYONE LOOK I'M A FICTIVE -->
<br>i'm very interested in how technology can assist art! from mspas to video games, music, and even animations, seeing what other people have made inspired me to start up a website just to see what i can do!!
<br>flash is one of my favorite technologies... being able to use code to help create animations, as well as being able to easily add animations to my code and designs is something that feels really special to me!
<br>since i've been working on it for so long, this site has a lot of stuff i wrote when i was younger. not all of it reflects my current thoughts or opinions on things... but it's still important to keep that information up. link rot is a girl's worst nightmare! :(

<br>psttt there's other people in my head. i was pulled right out of act 5 and injected into some girl around mid 2023
<br>the other people only usually "front" if shit is fuck
<br>it took me a while to figure out... what i am. i used to refer to myself as "rose", but thats more of a name that encompasses all of us
<br>rose was chosen as a name before we read homestuck, if you're wondering
<!-- woooo i love you osdd -->
<br>
<br>i'm also a trans girl!
