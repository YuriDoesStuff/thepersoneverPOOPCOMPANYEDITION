<br>pikmin 1 doesnt use the dpad at all! not even on the onion screen
<br>
<br>this is. kinda interesting... i think :p

<br>
<br>bulbmin sfx in pikmin 2 are/were apparently supposed to be sped up in game? their files are half the speed of what is heard in-game
<br>also! pikmin 2 reuses audio assets... theyre still at the same quality though. the original sfx for pikmin 2 sfx are at a much higher quality !
<br>
<br>the sfx for the swarming trumpet in pikmin 1* and 2 come from the leader, as apposed to being a global sound 
<br>
<br>if you enter another cave after getting white pikmin, then leave, the game will treat that as the begining of the next day... and will thus make the ship say "good morning", and have it tell you how to take out the whites
<br>also, going into any cave after acquiring the pikmin from a new onion will reset the onion at your base!
