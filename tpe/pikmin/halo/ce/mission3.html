<h1><span>the truth and reconciliation</span></h1>
<p><span>
oh god oh no! keyes is on a cruiser! what horrible information!!!
<br>luckily, you and your whits (as well as like 30 marines) can probably get to him within half an hour. 
<br>probably.

<p><span>
entering the first combat zone, cortana gives you the advice to use your sniper rifle against the covenant's gunners... 
</span></p>

<p><span>
this is generally good advice, mainly due to the fact that the sniper rifle is just. good.
</span></p>
<video loading="lazy" autoplay playsinline muted loop src=img/mission3/2.mp4 style="max-width: 800px;"></video>

<p><span>
also, remember to kill these guys in the stationary guns. assholes.
</span></p>
<img src=img/mission3/3.png loading="lazy" style="max-width: 800px;">

<p><span>
going up this hill, you can snipe some covenant before they notice you!
</span></p>
<img src=img/mission3/4.jpg loading="lazy" style="max-width: 800px;">
<p><span>
they really wanted you to have fun with the sniper here, huh...
</span></p>

<p><span>
in this combat zone, there is a <red>medpack</red> under the first ledge you meet! <red>DON'T MISS IT!!!!!</red>
</span></p>
<img src=img/mission3/5.gif loading="lazy" style="max-width: 800px;">

<p><span>
after clearing this zone out, you can enter the next area via the east-ish ledge here (the pointer on the AR always points north)
</span></p>
<img src=img/mission3/6.png loading="lazy" style="max-width: 800px;">

<p><span>
over the next hill... there's a few gunners... and an elite... kill it? for me?</span></p>
<video autoplay playsinline muted loop src=img/mission3/7.mp4 style="max-width: 800px;"></video>

<p><span>
once you're ready for the next area, you can find it over near the southwest area of the combat zone. it's a little hard to see but you'll find it, okay?
</span></p>
<img src=img/mission3/8.png loading="lazy" style="max-width: 800px;">

<p><span>
fighting up this hill is a really interesting encounter, seeing as you mainly have to progress into the enemy to find cover
</span></p>
<img src=img/mission3/9.jpg loading="lazy" style="max-width: 800px;">

<p><span>
there's 3 snipers here... subtle reminder to take out your sniper rifle
</span></p>
<img src=img/mission3/10.png loading="lazy" style="max-width: 800px;">

<p><span>
there's also another <red>medkit</red> near the back of the combat zone!! it's in a bit of a tricky spot, but go for it when you have downtime
</span></p>
<img src=img/mission3/11.gif loading="lazy" style="max-width: 800px;">

<p><span>
i think what makes this combat zone so memorable to me is that covenant keep pouring out of the TAR's gravlift, even as reinforcements come in from dropships
</span></p>
<img src=img/mission3/12.png loading="lazy" style="max-width: 800px;">

<p><span>
you even get some extra troops from foe hammer, showing how <i>important</i> this scene is.
</span></p>
<img src=img/mission3/13.png loading="lazy" style="max-width: 800px;">

<p><span>
i mean... after all, winning this battle is a vital step to saving captain keyes ^_^
</span></p>

<p><span>
hey huh the music is starting up again and OH MY GOD
</span></p>
<img src=img/mission3/14.png style="max-width: 800px;">
<p><span>WHAT.</span></p>
<h3><span>IS.</span></h3>
<h2><span>THAT.</span></h2>

<span>it's hunter!</span>
<br>
<a href=img/mission3/HUNTER.png loading="lazy" target=_blank><img src=img/mission3/15.gif style="max-width: 800px;"></a>

<p><span>
you can easilly kill one with a single shot by using your sniper. so do that!
<br>also make sure to actually hit their skin
</span></p>
<video autoplay playsinline muted loop src=img/mission3/16.mp4 style="max-width: 800px;"></video>

<p><span>
so, we're finally in the truth and reconciliation... after 17 Minutes and 38 Seconds...
</span></p>
<img src=img/mission3/17.png loading="lazy" style="max-width: 800px;">

<p><span>
good thing there are no SWORD ELITES on this ship! that would make everything so, so much more painful!
</span></p>
<img src=img/mission3/18.png loading="lazy" style="max-width: 800px;">
<p><span>
fuuuckkkkkkk
</span></p>

<p><span>
hey. look on the bright side! all you really gotta do is shoot them a lot before they slice you!
</span></p>
<video autoplay playsinline muted loop src=img/mission3/19.mp4 style="max-width: 800px;"></video>

<p><span>
there <i>they</i> are again... boo...
</span></p>
<img src=img/mission3/20.png loading="lazy" style="max-width: 800px;">

<p><span>
after defeating them, you go into this hallwOh man! looks like a great time for a fun DETOUR!!!!
</span></p>
<img src=img/mission3/21.png loading="lazy" style="max-width: 800px;">

<p><span>
into the purple halls we go... how fun...
</span></p>
<img src=img/mission3/22.jpg loading="lazy" style="max-width: 800px;">

<p><span>
traversing the halls takes you to this combat zone. this combat zone just is kinda horrible... go back into the interior hallway if your sheilds go down. and use lots of grenades. that's all i have to offer
</span></p>
