<br>NOT AGAINNNNNNNNNNN

<br>yeah you get yellow pikmin like immediately. though, you will need to construct a large bridge to get any fruits and/or gear back to base... 
<br>the bridge parts are scattered all over the map. 
<br>alph's bridge parts are as followed:
<br>through a dirt shortcut, or around a large snowbank to the right of where your camera is initially positioned, is an area with pyroclasmic slooches. youll need red pikmin to kill them! so bring red pikmin!!!!!
<br>heading out of that area, to the left of the begining of the blue bridge is an area with a bearded amprat. spamming rock pikmin should reliably kill them before they shock any pikmin... theres a bouncy mushroom you can bounce on to get to the bridge pieces
<br>britany's bridge pieces are as follows:
<br>to the left of the orange bridge, there are a few pieces inside some crystals. you'll have to find a way to swap pikmin between the two captains to collect these pieces! ^_^
<br>to the right is an area with an electric gate, and a swooping snitchbug. kill the snitchbug, and start breaking down the gate with any yellow pikmin you have :P
<br>behind the gate is a hilly area with a few artic cannon beetle larve, and a whiptounge bulborb. you should probably bring a lot of rock pikmin here...
<br>
<Br>once the bridge gets constructed, get both alph and britany to the president's boulder nose, and push it down to reveal the way to the boss area
<br>youll get a new captain this time! can you guess who
