<p id=text>breadbugs have a little hole that they bring treasures and corpses to. they&apos;re kinda annoying to kill? typically, you have to bring a treasure or corpse back to your ship as a breadbug is carrying it, but if you hit them on the head once once, they take damage. and once they take damage once... you&apos;ve pretty much nailed em forever<br>they can also kill pikmin! its a little hard to encounter naturally, but if they manage to bring something back to their hole with pikmin trying to carry it, they&apos;ll just. bring the pikmin in with the item and kill the pikmin that were trying to carry it. bleg</p>
