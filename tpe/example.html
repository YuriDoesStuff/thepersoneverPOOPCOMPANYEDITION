  <p><span>hey! this page isn't really needed as much anymore, due to most pages being responsive. however, if you feel like visiting some stuff in the vault, you should consider zooming your browser in or out! 
<br>to figure out how zoomed in or out you should be, use the spinning NES on the <a href=/oldhome target=_blank>old home page</a> :D</span></p>
<img src=/images/nesguide.png>
<p><span>the NES should be as close to the tpe logo thing as possible, without overlapping the logo anywhere in the animation 
<br>also... if you're on a desktop or laptop click the enter image!! you would not believe how many people don't know how to enter this site :(
