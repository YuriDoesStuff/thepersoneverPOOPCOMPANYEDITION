  <h1><span>my #epix laptop</span></h1>

  <p><span>this! is my laptop
  <br>it's a thinkpad t430s! it has a i5-3320m cpu, no gpu, a 100gb ssd, and 16 gigs of ram!
  <br>i got it as a hand-me-down from my mother when i was younger, and is thus pretty beat up. never give a laptop to a 12 year old everyone
  <br>i recently got a new main battery for it! the factory one had half of its battery zapped after 10 minutes of video playback, but the new one holds its own :o
  <br>this (along with i3 having keyboard navigation shortcuts) means that i've been willing to use it more as of recently! thus, i'm making a page for this laptop now :p
