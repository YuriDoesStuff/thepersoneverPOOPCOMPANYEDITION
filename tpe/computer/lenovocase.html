  <h1><span>hey. do you want to see the greatest computer ever.</span></h1> (im totally not lying!)
  <br><img class=mainimg src=https://i.imgur.com/O7lusjJ.jpeg>
  
  <p><span>this!! is the inside of my last computer
  <br>it currently has a 460gb ssd, an intel i7-3770 cpu, an nvidia k2200, and 16 gigs of ddr3 clocked at. um. 800mhz jesus christ
  <br>my pc is so cool 
  <br>the front i/o and power button dont work because i put a non-lenovo motherboard in a thinkcenter case... however, i have harvested the front i/o from a case meant for the currently installed motherboard, and got a seperate power button! now i dont have to short the power pins every time i want to power on the pc :P
  <br>i currently have windows 10 installed! not too long ago, i had <small>(or rather, have, since the data hasn't been wiped)</small> manjaro installed on it, but i'm too lazy to go back and set up grub... so, i'm just using WSL right now :p
  </span></p>

  <h2><span>dumb stupid upgrade history</span></h2>
  <p><span> got the tower! (16gb quad channel memory, no gpu, 520gb hdd)
  <br>inserted an nvidea 520 card
  <br>got a quadro 2200k for $20! its better than the xbox one's gpu :) 
  <br>realized i had a better cpu from a "junk" lot i got for free that actually works...
  <br>put in the greatest cpu known to man (an intel i7-3770. it only allows up to 2 modules of ram)
  <br>got a fan that ACTUALLY FITS ON THE MOTHERBOARD
  <br>upgraded ram size to dual 16 gigs! (two 8 gig modules) 
  <br>got an ssd...
  <br>took my usb external hdd out of its enclosure and connected it to my pc using sata! it's much faster than it was before :3
  <br>got an gtx 1060!!! (+ a new psu)
  <br>stole that new psu and gtx 1060 for use in my new main build
