    <h1><span> about this Silly Thing</span></h1>
    <p><span> heyo! im uh rose i guess? belh
    <br>i started making music one day when i was 13 because... i was really really bored i think? 
    <br>i really liked the pmd - explorers of (blank) at the time, so i just used a pmd - eos soundfont for like 3 songs
    <br>as i got more equipped with my music software though, i began to want more unique sounds... so i just decided to try to find as many soundfonts as i could.
    <br>eventually though, i found and wanted to mess with vsts! unfortunately, lmms was just <i>not</i> robust enough to handle vsts.
    <br>i just dont think lmms is robust enough in general im sorry
    <br>fl studio 20 is my best friend now :D 
    <br>if you know what kind of music i like you can easily tell where my inspiration comes from! i will not be buying the homestuck soundtrack on cd im sorry
    <br>
    <br>... i think thats it
