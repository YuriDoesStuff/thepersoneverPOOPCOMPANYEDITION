<h2><span> the distant spring</span></h2>


<br>
<p><span> after collecting around 23 parts, you can go into the distant spring
<br>the distant spring is the largest area in pikmin 1, due to having SO MUCH WATER!!!!!!!!!! it's also the hardest area, due to the fact that the enemies in the distant spring are all. harder than a bulborb :) 
<br>theres lots of wollywogs (which you should already know are dumb), 7 bulbears (which are just. tougher bulborbs), water dumples. dear god i hate water dumples, and puffy blowhogs. ok not all of the enemies are tougher than bulborbs. there are no new pikmin types!
<br>you will need a LOT of blue pikmin. theres so much water here...
<br>i hope you have the whimsical radar by this point
