    <p><span>heya!! im uh um uh a person i think
    </span></p>
    <p><span>
    <br> i started creating this site because i was super 
    <br> bored one summer and kinda wanted to get back into 
    <br> coding... i did some lua stuff before (in roblox. 
    <br> i am so cool),  and i even got a big ol book with 
    <br> a bunch of tutorials for  c and lua and python and 
    <br> html and more  but honestly i think i just needed 
    <br> something simple to get me into html. luckily, the 
    <br> neocities tutorial WAS simple! horray!!!
    <br>
    <br> i also realy wanted to get into web design after i 
    <br> saw melon's site... it had just so much to do and 
    <br> there were so many secrets and just OUGH! i hope my 
    <br> website has that much stuff some day
    <br> 
    <br> i like to think of this website as an ongoing thing,
    <br> so i can like look at what i have done and be like
    <br> "oh yeah ive been doing something with my life" rather
    <br> than just spending all of my days on social media 
    <br> wondering where it all went wrong
