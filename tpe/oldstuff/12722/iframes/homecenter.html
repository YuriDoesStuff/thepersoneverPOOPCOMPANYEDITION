    <p><span>heya!! im uh um uh a person i think
    <br>this is my first actual website,, so its basicly just 
    <br> linking to other sites across the net :P
    </span></p>
    <p><span>
    <br> i started this site up because i wanted to get 
    <br> back into coding.. i did some lua stuff before,, 
    <br> and i even got a "big book" with a bunch of stuff 
    <br> about like c and lua and python and even html 
    <br> (funnily enough..),, but online guides have always 
    <br> been.. easyier for me to follow
    <br> like,, the neocities basic tutorial taught me 
    <br>more that that book ever did :P 
    <br>..i also kinda wanted to actually get into web design.. 
    <br>like,, just making your own website and seeing other's 
    <br>websites that are all custom and cool is like.. so fun.. 
    <br>
    <br>..so,, yeah
    <br>
    <br> eeeventually,, ill wanna get this site to where theres 
    <br>like.. a whole day's worth of content to sift through,, 
    <br> not unlike mellon's site :P.. though,, thatll take
    <br> a  w h i l e  so.. just wait like 4 months for that
    <br> to happen :> 
    </span></p>
