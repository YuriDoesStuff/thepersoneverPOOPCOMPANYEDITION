<h1> wistful wild..</h1>

<br>
<br>
<p><span>..the wistful wild is the 4th and last area of the game,, and has 
<br> - 2 orange bulbs and a withering blowhog right next to eachother (Delete and run tatics :] )
<br> - every harder enemy ever
<br> - and a gun or something i wouldnt be suprised if it did
<br>
<br> some of the hardest caves are in this area.. the only harder caves in my opinion are in the valley of repose..
<br>..the final boss is in the dream den,, one of the caves in this area.. 
<br> my strategy for defeating him is 
<br> 
<br> 1: go through with a fairly ballanced team and get every treasure
<br> 2: DONT fight him with all your pikmin
<br> 3: go back with like 80 yellows and like 10 whites (the 10 whites are for the first subfloor)
<br> 4: throw all the whites outta the arena when you get to the final sublevel 
<br> 5: fight it for like. a half hour. yes it takes that long. if you use purples its like 20 minutes so like. yeah
<br> 6: pray you have enough pikmin by the end of it to pick every treasure up 
<br>
<br>..thats kinda it..
