  <br> the cover is reversable!! i mean tons of cd cases have "reversable art" but. yeah
  <br> you can also see my cd player in the background.. i wanted to be able to show off both disks,, so i put one of them in it,, and opened the case..

  <br><strong>9/10.. favorite track: Your Evil Shadow Has a Cup of Tea</strong>
