<h2><span>workarounds, workarounds, workarouds
<br />march 19th, 2024</span></h2>
<p><span>YESSSSSSSSSSSSS HI this website is BACK IN BUSINESS!
  <br>you know how my school outlawed the neocities editor. well. i found an online webdav client that lets me edit my website's files without the need for neocities :3</span></p>
  <img src=/images/filestash.png width=60%>
    <p><span>you can find it on <a href=https://demo.filestash.app target=_blank>filestash.app</a>! it's a lot more fully featured than the standard neocities editor... and can possibly allow other people in a similar situation to me to edit their websites. 
 <br>my website was blocked before i had the current domain name, so the school doesn't know that my website is hosted on thepersonever.net now. though, i would have very much prefered them to just block my subdomain... having the entirety of neocities blocked is extremely annoying :/
  <br>anyways! uh! i've been working on bloodbound some more. hit 100 pages! by this rate, it'll finally reach production by 2026!!! haha
  <br>i got a system made in pure javascript to play mp4s with the same interactivity as flashes in place to not ruin immersion... it also supports preloaders! 
   <br>i mainly made this due to issues with recursion in firefox when trying to run more complicated flashes. or maybe that issue was because i was replicating what hussie did to create the skaian portals exactly. i'm not sure
      <br>bloodbound has taught me a lot about flash animation :D before i started making animated panels, i was working on the full version of <a href=/flashes/pikitorytest target=_blank>pikitory</a>. at first, i was trying to draw in psds of varying pixelsizes... now, i try to draw in psds of the same size as the animation, and import pngs once they're finished! i know you can import psds themselves, but i usually have color on a seperate layer than the rest of each moving part... though, i might look into changing that soon? it could save me a lot of time exporting
      <br>bloodbound has also taught me about using the slice tool in photoshop! it's really good for creating spritesheets easily while not messing up porpotions. i could theoretically also import a psd for each spritesheet and make <a href=https://helpx.adobe.com/animate/using/elements.html target=_blank>symbols</a> for each object i want to animate, but that feels like. a lot of unnecessary work. it'll also run less smoothly when i try to move each object in-editor, due to moving like 20 bitmaps instead of 5. basically, i'm pretty sure what i'm currently doing is "good enough"
      </span></p>

<p><span>i've also learned a lot about php while working on bloodbound... from sql to $_GET, i've learned how to operate php effectively. now i just need to figure out how to style phpbb... 
 <br>drawing rooms is a lot harder than you would expect. you have to draw perfect lines applied to a grid at an angle, and make sure that everything lines up with the perspective you have currently. it kinda sucks. you also have to draw it with a much larger resolution if you want to be able to scale with your characters without much issue... but thats more of a me problem, due to the fact i'm still using photoshop cs5 instead of obtaining a more up-to-date copy of photoshop. 
 <br>wrapping back around to neocities, i'm going to start working on lofaf again :3 hopefully i can fix my instalation of TUHSC soon...
 <br>anddd that's it i think! see you on the other side of your screen
