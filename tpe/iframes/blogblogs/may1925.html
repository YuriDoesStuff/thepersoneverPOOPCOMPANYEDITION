	<p><span>1: barely update your site for a week
	<br>2: add a secondary site to your sites on nekoweb
	<br>3: move all of your site repos to github
	<br>4: get really really really lucky
	<br>5: profit????</span></p>

	<p><span>we're about to hit 40,000 nekoweb views as well! this means this site is 11% of the way to beating our <a href=https://neocities.org/site/thepersonever target=_blank>neocities views</a> </span></p>

	<p><span>other than that, um! i remade the entirety of PSFLA's website!</span></p>
	
	<img src=images/11typsfla.gif width=500>
	
	<p><span>i'm able to update PSFLA a lot more easily now, as i simply have to push the site repo to github when i want to publish my site... instead of doing a ton of SSH bullshit to update my sitefiles
	<br>also! <a href=https://github.com/rosefloase/thepersonever target=_blank>TPE</a> and <a href=https://github.com/psfla/11tyserver target=_blank>PSFLA</a>'s sitedocs are now publicly available! new monthly releases will still appear on the <a href=https://downloads.thepersonever.net/backup target=_blank>site backups</a> page, but i think being able to download the most recent version of TPE's files will be appreciated by. um. well.
	<br>someone i hope</span></p>
	
	<p><span>i think my favorite thing about 11ty is being able to easily update site-wide variables without a ton of relative pathing. i originally had this feature in the <a href=https://php.psfla.net/ target=_blank>php version of psfla</a>, but site-wide variables would break very easily from page to page :/</span></p>
	<p><span>also, not paying as much for two different hosting services is really nice! the hosting provide i (still) use for the php version of psfla doesn't charge a lot if less people go to the site, so i really just have to pay for nekoweb supporter now. don't drain my bank account after reading this post please</span></p>
	
	<p><span><a href=https://team.indieseas.net/ target=_blank>indiefellas</a>' <a href=https://github.com/indiefellas/deploy2nekoweb target=_blank>deploy2nekoweb</a> is one of the best tools for pushing your site easily from your local machine to a remote nekoweb site. i'm plugging this here because i seriously think it's better than nekogit and that anyone who knows how to set up an http daemon or xampp should use it!!! it was easy enough transitioning my nekogit repo to something that works with D2N, so if i can do it you probably can too :p</span></p>
	
	<p><span>btw um. school's almost out! when i'm fully away from hell i will be a site updating FIEND.</span></p>
	
	<img src=images/jadeFIEND.gif width=500>
	
	<p><span>that's mostly it. look forward to more the and nbsp semicolon person and nbsp semicolon ever content in the near future!</span></p>
