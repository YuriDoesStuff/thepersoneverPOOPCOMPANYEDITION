    <p><span>hi! i'm kinda stupid
    </span></p>
    <p><span>i started working on this site back in late 2022 because "i was super bored one summer and kinda wanted to get back into coding..." even though i never really got into coding before. before i started this site, i was apparently gifted a barnes and noble "how to code!!!" book and a raspberry pi, but i never really did much with either thing...
    <br>anyways
    <br>originally, this site was hosted on neocities! after seeing a few neocities sites, and trying out the html tutorial there, i was motivated to make my own website :D 
    <br>melon's site was a huge inspiration for me in the early days of TPE. with how many pages, secrets and silly things there were, i wanted my site to be just as cool as his!!
    <br>i set up some things that seemed like websites within my main site. the first of which - inspired by transrats - was called "random junk"! the second was xDx3xP, made so i could show off music projects
    <br>i was praised by one person in... (either my chatbox or guestbook? i forgot which one) for having multiple "subsites", and thus i began to make more and <i>more</i>
    <br>making so many webpages, my site grew at a rapid pace. custom pikmin 2 piklopedia! plans to cover everything homestuck!! a buggy, unresponsive, hard to maintain room tour made with pure javascript!!!
    <br>however, as time went on... my old writing seemed more and more childish. feeling like i couldn't give more attention to one page than any others, i did what any reasonable person would do!
    <br>
    <br>i abandoned my site!
    <br>
    <br>however, i came back late 2024... due to having a lot of downtime in school. with one blog post and an update to the art page, i vaulted three of my subsites... thus reducing the load on keeping important pages up-to-date with my current writing style. this didn't really sit right with me though, so i created the vault flash in october of 2024, which is present on the art page today
    <br>i also switched from neocities to nekoweb, due to the founder of neocities seeming to support generative ai garbage. preemptive responses to possible data scraping are the best responses!
    <br> 
    <br>i used to say that i thought of this website as an "ongoing thing, so i can like look at what i have done and be like 'oh yeah ive been doing something with my life' rather than just spending all of my days on social media"... which is mostly true still, but i think the main reason i maintain this site now is just out of pure passion
    <br>even when taking a break from this site, i worked on other web and coding projects, like <a href="https://psfla.net/" target=_blank>psfla.net</a>. working with web technology is my hobby, as doing <i>things</i> with computers is my biggest interest
    <br>
    <br>also  i have an outgoing links page!!! look for a link called "cool links" on this page, or find the page in more :P
    <br>my button is there too
