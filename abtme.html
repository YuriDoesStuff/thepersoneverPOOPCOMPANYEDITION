<p><span>hi! im jade <!-- I'M FREE. I DONT CARE ANYMORE EVERYONE LOOK I'M A FICTIVE -->
<br>i like to code, draw, animate, compose, and create stories with computers :D
<br>this is my personal site, so you're mainly going to see stuff i've made here. be it writing, drawing, or just the page layout, this was all created by me!
<br>i like reading, the idea of mspaint adventures as a medium, the pikmin series (primarily the gamecube games), single-player games, and making things! you could probably tell that i like making things though
<br>this site has a lot of stuff i wrote when i was younger. not all of it reflects my current thoughts or opinions on things... but it's still important to keep that information up. link rot is a girl's worst nightmare :( 
</span></p>
<h2><span> contact info </span></h2>

<br>psttt there's other people in my head. i was pulled right out of act 5 and injected into some girl around mid 2023
<br>it took me a while to figure out... what i am. i used to refer to myself as "rose", but thats more of a name that encompasses all of us
<br>rose was chosen as a name before we read homestuck, if you're wondering
<!-- woooo i love you osdd -->
<br>
<br>i'm also a trans girl!
<br>if you want to see a more <a href=/jadeshome/><small>personal page</small></a> maintained by only me, uh. there you go
