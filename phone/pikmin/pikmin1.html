<h2> <span>pikmin 1 on the nintendo gamecube and wii</span></h2>
<p><span> pikmin 1 is... pikmin 1 i guess
<br>you crash your ship on an alien planet (earth, most likely) and because of the DEADLY oxygen you only have 30 days to 
<br>collect the 30 parts of your space ship
<br>thats it! thats the only context you get!!!
<br>
<br>red pikmin, blue pikmin, and yellow pikmin were introduced in this game
<br> 
<br>reds are pretty great at fighting, with a 1.5x damage increase, and are also impervious to fire
<br>blues can traverse water, which is needed for a few ship parts... but they cant do anything special besides that
<br>yellow pikmin are. alright. they can be thrown higher, and can carry bomb rocks. theyre needed for around the same amount of parts as blue pikmin are
<br>
<br>there's 5(ish) areas in this game
<br>in order of being explored, said areas are:
