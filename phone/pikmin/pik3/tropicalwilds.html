<h1><span> tropical wilds </span></h1>

<p><span>this Area is so simple man... dot dot dot...
<br>theres an unfinished bridge, a cave back to alph's crash site, and a dirt wall next to where you land. bring a few yellows to the wall, and start digging, before going to get the fruit where alph found the red onion... 
<br>theres a few bulborbs protecting the fruit, so! remember to bring like 50 red pikmin!
<br>once the wall is destroyed, you'll need to fight a whiptounge bulborb. so. fight it!!!! 
<br>throw a captain to the other side of the bridge with a few pikmin. you'll only need to fight a swooping snitchbug, but some of the bridge pieces are in a crystal... 
<br>all of the bridge pieces are near the bridge already, so you dont really have to look for them :P
<br>once you complete the bridge, bring all 3 captains to the stump that's over some water, and throw two captains and 10 pikmin onto the stump. from the stump, throw your 10 pikmin and the remaining captain to the land mass in front of you, and push the bag down that is further up the path. you can now enter the boss arena with all of the pikmin you will need! have fun :)
