<p><span> so!!! uh 
<br> pikmin 4 exists... finally
<br> its been ten years since pikmin 3, so
<br> thats fun
<br>
<br> in pikmin 4, you play as... whoever you want to play as! as long as you can make them in the in game character creator
<br> said character is part of the "rescue corps", a space faring rescue team, who come to Not Earth to find and save olimar... who has crashed again :P
<br> well. maybe not again? the intro has olimar state that he "discovered" pikmin, even though this (presumably) takes place after pikmin 1... which stars olimar as the sole speaking character
<br> anyways
<br> something goes Horribly Wrong for the rescue corps too though! everyone on the rescue corps' space ship is cast on to seperate areas of pnf-404, and are... trapped i guess?
<br> fortunately you, The Dog, mr intercoms, and The Guy in Charge of Dogs all land near the ship. 
<br>
<br> and after that, you are off! go play the demo if you want to know more about the first hour of the game ^_^
