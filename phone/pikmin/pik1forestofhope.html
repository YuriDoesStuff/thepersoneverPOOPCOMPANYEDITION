<h2><span> the forest of hope</span></h2>

<br>
<br>
<p><span>the forest of hope is the first real area in pikmin 1!
<br>you find yellow pikmin, bomb rocks, and lots of bulborbs here. lots of bulborbs
<br>theres around 7 parts... almost half of which are behind reinforced walls, which can only be destroyed with bomb rocks 
<br>you're meant to use blue pikmin to find 3 parts, but you can technically complete the area with only reds and yellows using SPEEDRUNNING STRATEGIES
<br>
<br>one of my favorite pieces of game design from this game as a whole is that one yellow 20 pellet on a stump
<br>if you're a newer player, you might think "heyyy i dont need 40 yellows!!!!! ill just get it with my reds :3"
<br>reds cant jump high enough to reach it, though. if you've forgotten that yellows can jump higher, you would most likely use logic like "<i>hm... yellow pellet... there were red pellets in the impact site... there's yellow pikmin.... maybe i could reach it with yellow pikmin...?</i>" to figure out what to do
