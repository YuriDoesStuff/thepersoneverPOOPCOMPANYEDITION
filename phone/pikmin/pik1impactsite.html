<h2><span>the impact site</span></h2>

<p><span> 
<br>the impact site is the first playable area in pikmin 1. its where you encounter red pikmin, and learn the controls of the first two pikmin games
<br>yeah theres like two parts here and a ton of pellets. there isnt much
<br>on the first day, you can grow ~25 pikmin, and you have to collect the first ship part, which is the engine
<br>the second part can only be collected once you get blues and yellows... due to needing to destroy a reinforced wall, and having to defeat an enemy in water 
<br>the enemy that houses the part is a pearly clam-clamp! usually, they drop a pearl that makes like. 50 pikmin? i dont know ive only fought the one that houses the ship part
<br>after day one there are a LOT of pellets strewn around the first area. like. so many. its almost scary 
<br>...i dont think theres much else to talk about here
