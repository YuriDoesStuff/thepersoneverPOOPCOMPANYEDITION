    <p><span> hello! i'm jade, the person behind this... music project
    <br>some time in 2022, i started making music due to just. being bored! :p 
    <br>i used LMMS at first, due to not being able to fully install programs at the time. we love you portableapps &lt;3
    <br>when i started out, i was really into PMD... especially explorers of darkness. so, i looked up a soundfont for the explorers games, and used that as my primary soundbank!
    <br>however, as i got my own pc and became more familiar with my music software, i began to want more unique sounds... so, i started using more and more soundfonts!!! :D
    <br>eventually though, thanks to my EPIC FRIEND AUTUMN SKATEBOARD, aka scalarknight, i found out about fl studio! and vsts! and easy-to-use plugins/effects!!!
    <br>one trip to the internet archive later, i had a copy of fl studio 20 :D
    <br>i used that for a while, but i had to use the 32-bit version, due to 20's built-in soundfont player only being supported on the 32-bit exe. finding out (with the help of scalarknight) that the 32-bit version just had <i>horrible</i> export times, i moved over to fl studio 21, due to it having a 64 bit version of the soundfont player!!!!
    <br>for a while i ran fl studio 21 under manjaro, using bottles. i wasn't able to test any VSTs before <asdf title="flash pro sucks on linux. ok.">moving back to windows</asdf>... but bottles made it easier to install than trying to just use it with only wine!! i could actually see the note labels on the piano roll it was wonderful
	<br>right now, i'm running FLS 24 on windows 10. works good! it has a nice boot up screen where i can choose my most recent project by clicking on a big grey button
    <br>
    <br>a lot of my music is inspired by stuff that i listen to. what a shocker! find out what cds i have <a href=/randomerjunk/cds target=_blank>here!</a>
