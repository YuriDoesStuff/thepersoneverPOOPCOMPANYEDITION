    <p><span> hello! i'm jade, the person behind this... music project
    <br>some time in 2022, i started making music due to just... being bored :p 
    <br>i used LMMS at first, due to not being able to fully install programs at the time. we love you portableapps &lt;3
    <br>when i started out, i was really into PMD... especially explorers of darkness. so, i looked up a soundfont for the explorers games, and used that as my primary soundbank!
    <br>however, as i got my own pc and became more familliar with my music software, i began to want more unique sounds... so, i started using more and more soundfonts!!! :D
    <br>eventually though, thanks to my "EPIC FRIEND AUTUMN SKATEBOARD", aka scalarknight, i found out about fl studio! and vsts! and easy-to-use plugins/effects!!!
    <br>one trip to the internet archive later, i had a copy of fl studio 20 :D
    <br>i used that for a while, but i had to use the 32-bit version, due to 20's built-in soundfont player only being supported on the 32-bit exe. finding out (with the help of scalarknight) that the 32-bit version just had <i>horrible</i> export times, i moved over to fl studio 21, due to it having a 64 bit version of the soundfont player!!!!
    <br>i'm currently running fl studio 21 under manjaro, using bottles. i haven't tested any VSTS yet... but bottles made it easier to install than trying to just use it with only wine!! i can actually see the note labels on the piano roll this is wonderful
    <br>
    <br>whenever i try to listen to music deliberately, i try to focus only on what i'm listening to. however, due to how busy i am now i don't have much time to listen to music anymore!!! D: 
    <br>even still... some bands that i remember liking were lemon demon (he was my main inspiration to start making music... you can still find a lot of the stuff he made when he was 12!!!), will wood, green day, weird al, and a lot of music by the homestuck sound team
