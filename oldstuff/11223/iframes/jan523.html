<p><span>heyos!!!
<br>a lil while ago,, as in like.. 4 days ago,, i got my mom's old windows xp laptop.. from one of my dad's friends
<br> its got half a gig of ram,, and a intel celeron m (1.30 ghz max).. so its not the fastest thing ever..
<br> heck,, it has trouble closing mypal.. 
<br> but!! more ram is shiping!! and i can still uh.. use bitview on it :P
<br> it also doesnt have wifi intergrated into it... but it has a internet card,, so it still connects to the internet '_'
<br>
<br>..i kinda just use it as a thing to download things onto while other things are busy.. i have an antivirus,, mypal (a browser),, and photoshop :P
<br> for <em>some reason</em> i tried to install roblox on it at one point,, but xp isnt supported anymore.. so uh.. yeah im dummy
<br>
<br>..i think thats it..
