<h1> the valley of repose..</h1>

<br>
<br>
<p><span> 
<br> the valley of repose is the first area in pikmin 2,, and it really feels like it..
<br> on day 1,, olimar kinda crash-lands onto the spot were they were supposed to land normally,, and gets seperated from louie.. after killing a dwarf bulborb (that is coded so that it literally cant kill pikmin),, louie is located,, and the main gimmic of pikmin 2 shows its face.. two capitans working together !!
<br> louie descovers the red onion,, and it spits out a single seed.. theres a few pellet posies around him,, so thats how he gets 11 pikmin..
<br>
<br> once louie and olimar are reunited,, they take the dwarf bulborb that was Deleted over to the onion to create a grand total of 20 pikmin,, and slowly.. cary back.. a battery.. that needs 20 pikmin.. with 20 leaf pikmin..
<br> the second day is more normal.. your able to get like 50 more pikmin and almost fully open up the map,, spawning around a ton of pellet posies.. theres still a pool of water thatll need to be drained later,, but for now.. you can go as far as the first cave
<br>
<br> thats where you find purple pikmin : ) 
<br>
<br>.. yeah bye
