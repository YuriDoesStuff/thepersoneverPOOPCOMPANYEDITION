<p><span> pikmin 1 is.. well,, pikmin 1
<br> you crash your ship on an alien planet (earth,, probably) and because of the Deadly Oxygen,, you only have 30 days to get all the parts of your ship back...
<br> ..you have 30 ship parts,, so technically you need to just get one part each day..
<br> you might finish this on your first run?? maybe????
<br> i didnt.. because i was lazy :P 
<br> red pikmin,, blue pikmin,, and yellow pikmin were introduced in this game
<br> 
<br> reds are your fighters,, with like a 1.5x damage increase,, and being invincible to fire and all..
<br> blues are better for navigation,, especially in the second to last area of the game,, the distant spring..
<br> yellows are.. useful,, because they can carry bomb rocks.. but if they let every pikmin carry bomb rocks,, they would only really be good for getting a few parts faster than you would otherwise..
<br> ..
<br>
<br> there's 5ish areas in this game..
<br> in order of unlocks is..
