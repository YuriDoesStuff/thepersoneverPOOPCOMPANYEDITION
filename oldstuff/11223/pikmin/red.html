<div class=right>
<p> <span> a red pikmin... </span></p>

<br>
<p><span> red pikmin.. they go from "usefull!!! ('w')b" in one to "eh" in 2 then back to "usefull!!!!! ('_')b" in 3  
<br>
<br> in 1,, theyre like the must have type..
<br> in 2,, theyre....... overshadowed
<br> and in 3.. theyre the most base pikmin you can get without being useless
<br> they do like 1.5x the base damage of other pikmin types.. which is really good when theres like 3 types,, but when theres a type thats basicly perfect for fighting..
<br>....yeah,, they get overshadowed
<br> red pikmin are just.. there,, in 2..
<br>
<br> in 3.. they tecnically get beaten out by rock pikmin because.. they do 5x damage when thrown ontop of something,, and 2x damage when just throwing themselves onto something..
<br> though,, rock pikmin cant hold onto stuff while attacking.. lowering their attack rate
<br>
<br> also- purples were chopped into pikpik carrots in 3's multiplayer sooooo yeah
