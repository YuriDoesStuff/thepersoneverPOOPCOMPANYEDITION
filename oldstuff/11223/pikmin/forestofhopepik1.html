<br>
<p><span>  the forest of hope is the first real area in the game.. 
<br> with like 7 parts,, a few of which you need blue piks for,, and 2 bosses.. its an actual area!! (wowza)
<br> you find the first bulborbs here,, right next to a ship part actually 
<br> ..as well as yellows and bomb rocks..
<br>
<br> honestly,, i really like that theres a yellow 20 up on a stump
<br> you might think at first "heyy i dont need 40 yellows ill just get it with my reds" if your somewhat stupid
<br>..the reds cant actually reach it,, so you might go and get yellows..
<br> like- why would it be a yellow unchanging if it was just.. hard to reach..? 
<br> so then,, you would throw the yellows,, and realise they have a higher jump
<br> teaching you for the future how high yellows can jump..
<br>
<br> i just think this area is neat :^]
