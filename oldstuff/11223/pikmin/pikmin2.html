<p><span> pikmin 2 is cooler than me
<br> after olimar returns to his home planet,, he finds out that the company he works for (hocotate freight) is in serious debt..
<br> like 10100 pokos in debt
<br> how much money is that in like usd or whatever????
<br> nobody knows <3
<br> so.. hes forced by the president of the company to go back to Not Earth,, and collect a bunch of treasure.. 
<br> ..also the ship you rebuilt in the first game is sold off haha
<br> 
<br> red and blue pikmin remain unchanged for the most part,, while yellows gain the power of EELECTRICITY to break down eletric gates and not instantly die when touching anything with a current
<br> there's also 2 new types.. white pikmin and purple pikmin
<br> white pikmin are fast and do stuff fast and also can go through poison and also poision enemys who eat them and also are stupid (but a more subjective stupid)
<br> purple pikmin are AAAAAAA theyre big and fat and slow but they can stomp enemies and sometimes home in on them and stun them and also they have a carrying amount of 10 but there slower than one leaf pikmin so . yeaf
<br> busted pikmanz!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! aaaaa
<br>
<br> this game also introduced the ultra spicy and ultra bitter sprays,, which will be denoted with uS and uB in this uh.. thing
<br>
<br> there are like 4 areas in pikmin 2
