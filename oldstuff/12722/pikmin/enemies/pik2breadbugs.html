<center><h1>breadbugs</h1></center>
<p><span>all of the Actual Breadbugs have a lill hole that they bring treasures and corpses to,, instead of there just being One that holds One Ship Part
<br>theyre kinda annoying to Delete,, but if you nail em once,, youve pretty much nailed em forever
<br>they can also kill pikmin!! if they manage to bring something back to their hole with pikmin trying to carry it back to the ship pod,, theyll just. bring the pikmin in with the Thing,, therefore killing the pikmin</span></p>
