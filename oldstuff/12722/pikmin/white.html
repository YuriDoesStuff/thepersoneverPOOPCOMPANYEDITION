<p><span> white pikmin are just. fayst 
<br> at buds,, they move at normal flower pikmin speeds.. 
<br> and at flowers,, they just.. they go faster than either captian's base speed
<br>
<br> theyre also poisonus.. some people see it as an "incentive" to just.. throw some white pikmin at some things instead of actually fighting them..
<br> but honestly.. i see it as more of a "WELP you just got one of your rare pikmin killed. Good Job crapface. theyre also poisonious so. it wasnt a complete waste. but still. take better care of your pikmin, NERD." 
<br>
<br> as you can tell im really nice to myself
