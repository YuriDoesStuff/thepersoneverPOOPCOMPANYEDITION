<p><span> the final trial is well.. the final trial of pikmin 1
<br> first,, you gotta go through an all types puzzle segment.. its easy enough,, though i always choke on the bomb rock collecting section ;; 
<br> though,, the final boss of the games is there afterwards..
<br> ive killed him ONCE and i dont even remember how..
<br> i think i just used bomb rocks?? idk
<br>
<br> he drops the final treasure.. and after you collect that,, the day immediately ends,, and it plays the Happy end cutscene.. 
<br>..
<br> yeah tiny level
