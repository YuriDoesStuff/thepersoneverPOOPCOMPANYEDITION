<p><span> pikmin 3 [deluxe] is the 3rd entry in the pikmin game,, and OBJECTIVLY THE BEST apparently even though its not my favorite
<br> you play as 3 of the kopites,, a new space race or whatever,, whos planet is on the verge of fammine.. 
<br> theyre sent to Not Earth,, now called pnf 404,, to collect berries and other fruit..
<br> there are like 66 fruits to collect,, which give you 99 days.. each fruit can give you from half a day to like 3 days,, but generally each fruit gives you another day to finish the game
<br> ..this is my least played entry so this is just here as like. a placeholder until i actually enter some of the main themes into my skull :P
