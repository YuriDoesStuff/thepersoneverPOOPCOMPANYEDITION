<h1> the distant spring..</h1>
</center>

<br>
<br>
<p><span> after collecting 19ish parts,, your pushed into the distant spring.. 
<br>the distant spring is the biggest area in pikmin 1,, with like 10 parts,, a ton of harder enemies,, and being generally hard to traverse with all that water,, the distant spring feels like the hardest area of pikmin 1..
<br> ..which it should,, because this is the final area before the final trial.. 
<br> theres a ton of bulbears,, a ton of wollywogs,, water dumples that are like way too fast,, and only a handfull of bomb rocks that you need to use to break down some walls.. 
<br> ..a few of the treasures can be collected easily.. though,, you will still need to go into the fray to collect a lot of parts..
<br> its just.. generally not a safe place to be in.. watch your step here
<br>
<br> i would say my favorite part to get here would be the #2 ionium jet,, with you needing to throw pikmin onto a ledge thing,, and then get yourself up with a geyser..
<br> though,, most people prefer the chronos reactor,, and i can see why.. but i just dont care ;P
<br>
<br> i think tahts it..
