<center><a1> HAZARDS</a1></center>
<p><span> ok ok in pikmin 1,, the only two elemental hazards were fire and water
<br> fire could be put out by wistling your pikmin if they were on fire,, and water could be deleted by wistling your pikmin out of the water
<br>
<br> ..that kinda changed in 2
<br> they added water as a fire-like hazard,, as well as poision
<br> poision is white pikmin,, fire is red,, water is blue,, and yellow is..
<br>..electricity
<br> insta-kill to anything thats not a yellow pikmin 
<br>
<br> ..
<br>
<br> yeah,, this is how they made yellow pikmin matter more than just "haha bomb rocks"
