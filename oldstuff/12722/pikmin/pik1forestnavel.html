<h1><span> the forest navel..</span></h1>
</center>

<br>
<br>
<p><span> after collecting like 5 parts,, your thrown into the forest navel..
<br> its quite a bit harder than the forest of hope.. but you should still be able to traverse the landscape with general safety,, if your smart.. 
<br> theres fire geysers,, tons of water at one part,, hec,, theres even wollywogs..
<br> you also land on a mound-type thing.. you can build bridges to be able to move things up the mound faster,, but you can generally hop down each part of the mound
<br>
<br> if you dont know what wollywogs are,, well..
<br> they can kill tons of your pikmin quite easily.. 
<br> so. look up videos of how the Professionals defeat them!!
<br> 
<br>..theres two bosses again,, but one of them is like.. actually scary
<br> not in its design,, but just.. how deadly it is.. 
<br> i'll cover that one later haha >:P 
<br> in the "piklopedia"!! (quotes because its more in-game statty lol) 
<br>
<br> theres like. a part at the beginning of the area that you can get with any pikmin if you build a pikmin-only bridge..
<br>..but you can also just throw like 20 yellows to get it..
<br>
<br>..
<br>I FORGOT TO MENTION THAT YOU GET BLUES IN THIS AREAAA
<br>
<br> theyre like.. close to the bottom of the mound
<br> they get like 15 pellets :P 
<br>
<br> so.. yeah
