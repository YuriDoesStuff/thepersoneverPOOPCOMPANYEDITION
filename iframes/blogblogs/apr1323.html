<br> what the Heck is an exodus???? anywyas
<br> ive! been uh. consuming media yeah
<br> uh!!!! heres like sokme games ive been playing!!! and brief summaries 
<br> i played!!!!
<br> starfox 64 - its like starfox snes but i can actually beat the first stage. its also got really good music too and its fun once you play it for like 4 hours. how are you supposed to beat andross ive gotten chewed up so much its so
<br> warriors (yeah) - heckingf!!!!!! ist like if books were about cats and the cats were personified and!!! if you didnt recognise anything. they also have there own mini language based off of english 
<br> pikmin two but on a crt - it looks hecking!!!! really good. like. it was meant for a more blurry display or something :^] 
<br> i actually beat it!!!! like a week and a half ago but still!!!
<br> pikmin 3 wii u !! i think i like this version more that the switch one... like u can set up the gamepad as like a second monitor and become able to check every single pikmin ever sprouted in your current save basically??? also switching captains is the same every time. ALSO also i like the camera and stuff more. and the controls aha. like. 
<br> pikmin one and twoâ€™s wii ports didnt really click all that well for me... like... this series was made for the pointer, but not these games. but!!! pikmin 3 was made with the pointer in mind so it feels like right!!!! and good!!! and hggh
