<p><span>so. uh... can you guess why i made this based off of the title
<br>tpe's first birthday came and went! didn't really have anything planned, so nothing really happened in celebration of its birthday... haha
<br>i made another song! it's not an original composition, but i put a lot more effort into the mixing than i really have for any song before... i think its good at least!
<br>i actually DID make an entire webpage for my computer. check it out <a href=/computer/ target=_parent>here</a>!
<br>finally (for site stuff), i've rewritten just about everything for pikmin 1, and am rewriting stuff for pikmin 2... well, not so much rewriting anymore! im working on the information for the caves now :P
<br>as for personal stuff... my break was ok. i got burnt out on an animation i was producing, and had to take a few days to just relax... during those days where i was relaxing, i found a mod for pikmin 2 called "bikmin 269". its... a little horrific, but it has a lot of effort put into it, and is much harder than pikmin 2. i think i might make a section for mods in jfp later...? but not until most of the mainline games have their information spread out. 
<br>i've also started playing animal crossing! i really don't think im all that good at talking to my villagers, but i'll get better over time... i hope
<br>
<br>sorry for being a Very Responsible Web Dev again
