<h2><span> new year new domain
<br> january 11, 2024</span></h2>
<p><span>hello everyone! in the past 11 days, things have been. cooking.
<br> - i started up another fan site on tpe :D
<br> - i got a new domain name!!
<br> - neocities has been entirely blocked at my school.
<br>
<br>so! uh. i'll talk about lofaf first
<br>lofaf is a HOMESTUCK FANSITE... it's going to have information about sburb itself, a lot of the major characters (sorry, trolls created after the scratch!), and other things that intrest me about the comic :3
<br>so far, i set up a style, made pages for the beta kids and WV, and started work on the sylladex page!
<br>i'm planning on having a viewer to see each character's diffrent appearences, sorta like a wiki. this is all just a proprietary wiki after all, haha
<br>
<br>the new domain name i got set up JUST THIS LAST HALF HOUR! i'll have to change all the links elsewhere to thepersonever.net... but hey! at least people know im Certified Autistic now
<br>
<br>as for neocities being blocked at my school. it's mainly just annoying for me... i'll work on my website at home for the days that i can't at school! it's a lot more fulfilling than just watching youtube all night :p
<br>
<br>see you all... SOOOOOONNNNNN OOOOOOOHHHHH OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOHHHHHHHH
