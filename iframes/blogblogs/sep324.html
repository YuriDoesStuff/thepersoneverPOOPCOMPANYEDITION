<h2><span>i don't know how much longer i can maintain this site
<br>september 3rd, 2024</span></h2>
<p><span>there's too much to do
  <br>almost everything on this site is either out of date, doesn't match my current views or writing style, or just plain sucks
  <br>the scope of this site has gotten so big that i can't keep up with all of the work i have currently. it's unrealistic to expect myself to completely rewrite every article for each game in JFP, for example, every three months
  <br>i started this site because i had nothing better to do
  <br>this site is being maintained less because i have more things to do
  <br>
  <br>i'm not saying that i will never revisit any topics covered by the majority of my subsites, but that many of the encyclopedic ones will go in a vault, and will most likely not be added onto
  <br>
  <br>yet, nothing is final
  <br>nothing is forever
