    <p><span>heya!! im uh um uh a person i think
    </span></p>

    <br> i started creating this site because i was super 
    <br> bored one summer and kinda wanted to get back into 
    <br> coding... i did some lua stuff before (in roblox. 
    <br> i am so cool),  and i even got a big ol book with 
    <br> a bunch of tutorials for c and lua and python and 
    <br> html and more  but honestly i think i just needed 
    <br> something simple to get me into html. luckily, the 
    <br> neocities tutorial WAS simple! horray!!!
    <br>
    <br> i also realy wanted to get into web design after i 
    <br> saw melon's site on neocities... it had just so much 
    <br> to do and there were so many secrets and just OUGH! 
    <br> it was SO cool. however, after managing like 3 
    <br> subsites, i don't think i could maintain a site with 
    <br> that much content.
    <br>
    <br> i've also switched from neocities to nekoweb as of
    <br> late, due to the founder of neocities seeming to
    <br> support generative ai garbage. preemptive responses
    <br> to possible data scraping are the best
    <br> 
    <br> i like to think of this website as an ongoing thing,
    <br> so i can like look at what i have done and be like
    <br> "oh yeah ive been doing something with my life" rather
    <br> than just spending all of my days on social media 
    <br> wondering where it all went wrong
    <br>
    <br> yes i have an outgoing links section just keep looking at the webpage your currently on :P
