  <br> heres thoughts from. younger me:
  <br> "i genuinly dont get the hate for this version of the game..
  <br> like,, sure theres better versions of this game
  <br> and better gba games..
  <br> but its more fun than some people give it credit!!
  <br> like.. it controlls as good as the dreamcast version of crazy taxi at least (yes im insulting the dc version :D) 
  <br> and its just. a gba version of crazy taxi soooo
  <br> yeah"
  <br>
  <br> i still agree with it i just dont feel like rewording it
