        <br>
        <p>1: i would like to preface this by saying chances are sburb is not real, all of this is an insane schizonightmare, and were just making this up to entertain ourselves. if you look back at this and think im stupid or anyone else, we likely are. this is just in the case that all of this turns into a horrible sburb session and i need to set everyones priorities straight. i may turn out to be the leader, i may not. who knows. im just taking the reigns here because its important that we all get together perfectly and nobody dies.</p>
		<p>2: if youve obtained a copy, do not give it to anyone outside of who has already been stated. it goes as the following;
<br>coffee moth
<br>cyber
<br>faceache
<br>yoruko
<br>barrie
<br>jade
<br>witchdagger
<br>barries moirail
<br>yuridoesstuff
<br>zezzy
<br>coffee moths friend
<br>nick</p>
<p>3: if you have managed to pass the first test and enter into your medium mostly intact, the first priority will be to give eachother the captcha codes for necessities like food, water, and a weapon. we are dumb teenagers that dont have plot armor presumably so we really need to focus on not dying. once we manage to hold out against imps and ogres which will be a massive thorn in the side, we should explore our lands, then meet up.</p>
<p>4: i forgot to say, but if youre gonna prototype shit, prototype as weak of a sprite you possibly can. a plush (or dead relative) (make sure it can speak) would be desirable.</p>
<p>5: DONT TOUCH THE SPRITE</p>
<p>6: we cannot attack eachother or cause drama with eachother, no matter how strong the urge is. we need to work together. thats what sburbs all about i guess. we are a team and we can do this together, but we cant survive long if we are constantly beefing and arguing with eachother.</p>
