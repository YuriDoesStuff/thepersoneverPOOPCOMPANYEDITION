    <title>subaspect theory</title>
  </head>
  <body>


<p>sburb may assign aspects based off a "what's this person closest to?" basis. if an aspect is already present in the session, it may pick based off of what the closest aspects avalible are</p>
<p>players' subaspects should be described in this format: primary/secondary/tertiary/ect</p>
<p>if a heart/mind/breath player enters first, their aspect will be heart. however, if a heart/life/space player enters second,their aspect will be life!</p>
<br>
<p>the next bit was written back when we were only sure that i, yuri, cyber, and dagger were playing... so it's not really relevant anymore. however, it does serve as a good example of how subaspects work :p</p>
<br>
<p>yuri has a primary heart aspect, and cyber has a primary mind aspect</p>
<p>if they enter first, dagger will most likely be placed as space (heart/space). if i enter after both a space and mind player are present, i will most likely be marked as time (space/mind/time/doom)</p>
<p>subaspects being assigned in this way is just a theory, though. we really need to focus on finding a dedicated time player to increase our odds of... actually having one</p>
<p>
  sburb is buggy as hell, so i wouldn't be suprised if this failsafe just. isn't present
