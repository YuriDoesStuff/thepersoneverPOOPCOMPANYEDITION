personal favorites

-- neon genesis evangelion -- 
idk this one's just fun :)
i love the writing in this show. it covers its more serious topics like corruption and jealousy in interesting ways relevant to the main draw of the show, while also splicing in great bits of comedy throughout its episodes. each battle against the angels in the show feels appropriately desperate too, with these segments having the best animation out of any segments in the show

-- american idiot --
a raw album, packed with many emotions
american idiot is a wonderfully executed album thanks to its distinct songs, along with its coherent and heart-hurting story. it approaches themes that are still relevent today, and has a sound i'm really fond of
it breaks my brain in a good way
