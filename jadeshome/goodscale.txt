woohoo! i love planning reviews for my Good Scale:tm:!

what dreams are made of.

-- night in the woods --
an incredibly human game
night in the woods touches so many themes and topics, while having wonderfully constructed characters that just. feel like real people
so much love and care was put into this game and you can really tell... from the more impactful conversations to the lighthearted chatter, all the characters have a very prominent personality! everyone reacts to story events in an incredibly believeable way, and i really enjoy both its comedy and how it addresses its more serious topics

-- homestuck --
a wonderful exploration of the web's capabilities for storytelling
homestuck, typically described as a "webcomic", is really nothing like a webcomic
all mspaint adventures (the series/medium homestuck belongs to) follow the same format: each webpage has its own unique panel and paragraph. sometimes, text may be absent to lend more focus to the panel, but pages like that are usually far between each other.
homestuck of course follows this format, but it also bends it. some pages have flash animations, interactive games, multiple panels, or panels that stretch out of the typical bounds of a panel for impact. sometimes, the entire theming of a webpage is changed to give viewers a sense that Shit is Happening!! the way homestuck deconstructs typical media, be it web content or general writing tropes, is incredible
speaking of writing, homestuck also has incredible literary content. characters react in believeable ways, and are all incredibly distinctive. while a few characters are pushed to the side shortly after being introduced, much of the cast is still incredibly fleshed out - to the point that there's very few characters that feel like "side characters". though it takes a while to get through every character's introductions, when shit starts happening it happens FAST. homestuck is a joy to read through, and can be analized to hell and back due to its over 8000 webpages

-- ultrakill --
playing ULTRAKILL is habit forming. don't turn off your PC!
ultrakill is a hard as hell shooter all about moving fast as fuck and having the reaction time of a robot
you play as v1, one of the last robots produced for a humanity-destroying war. your objective? using the blood of hellspawn to keep yourself from dying
enemies in ultrakill hit incredibly hard no matter what difficulty you are playing at; the differing difficulties only providing more time to react to your foes. the game gives you many options for extracting fuel from your enemies, letting players create and lean into their own prefered playstyle - though rewarding players who switch weapons and pull off skillful kills more bountifully 
all of these factors lead to ultrakill being an addicting shooter, where it feels like you're always getting better. however, the main thing that keeps <i>me</i> addicted to ultrakill is the movement! the physics of the game allow for incredibly fast movement that requires percise timing - such as having to hit control right as you hit the ground to maintain your speed into a slide after jumping. having to balance moving fast and being able to dodge is very challenging, but i enjoy that challenge a lot! there are also a lot of unlocks - such as the rocket launcher and wiplash (which acts as a grappling hook) - that further increase your mobility.

personal favorites

-- neon genesis evangelion -- 
idk this one's just fun :)
i love the writing in this show. it covers its more serious topics like corruption and jelousy in interesting ways relivent to the main draw of the show, while also splicing in great bits of comedy throughout its episodes. each battle against the angels in the show feels appropriately desperate too, with these segments having the best animation out of any segments in the show

-- pikmin 2 --

-- american idiot --
a raw album, packed with many emotions
american idiot is a wonderfully executed album thanks to its distinct songs, along with its coherent and heart-hurting story. it approaches themes that are still relevent today, and has a sound i'm really fond of
it breaks my brain in a good way
