				"description":"an incredibly human game <br> night in the woods touches so many themes and topics, while having wonderfully constructed characters that just. feel like real people <br> so much love and care was put into this game and you can really tell... from the more impactful conversations to just the lighthearted chatter, all the characters display a very prominent personality :D <br> everyone reacts to story events in an incredibly believable way, no matter how small their role is, and i really enjoy both its comedy and how it addresses its more serious topics"},

				"description":"a wonderful exploration of the web's capabilities for storytelling <br>homestuck, typically described as a \"webcomic\", is really nothing like a webcomic <br>all mspaint adventures (the series/medium homestuck belongs to) follow the same format: each webpage has its own unique panel and paragraph. sometimes, text may be absent to lend more focus to the panel, but pages like that are usually far between each other. <br>homestuck of course follows this format, but it also bends it. some pages have flash animations, interactive games, multiple panels, or panels that stretch out of the typical bounds of a panel for impact. sometimes, the entire theming of a webpage is changed to give viewers a sense that Shit is Happening!! the way homestuck deconstructs typical media, be it web content or general writing tropes, is incredible <br>speaking of writing, homestuck also has incredible literary content. characters react in believeable ways, and are all incredibly distinctive. while a few characters are pushed to the side shortly after being introduced, much of the cast is still incredibly fleshed out - to the point that there's very few characters that feel like \"side characters\". though it takes a while to get through every character's introductions, when shit starts happening it happens FAST. homestuck is a joy to read through, and can be analized to hell and back due to its over 8000 webpages"

				"description":"playing ULTRAKILL is habit forming. <a href=\"https://www.deviantart.com/sonicchaoyt/art/SA2-Habit-HD-908821634\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"yes i know this isn't the original texture i'm just lazy\">don't turn off your PC!</a> <br>ultrakill is a hard as hell shooter all about moving fast as fuck and having the reaction time of a robot <br>you play as v1, one of the last robots produced for a humanity-destroying war. your objective? to use the blood of hellspawn as life support <br>enemies in ultrakill hit incredibly hard no matter what difficulty you are playing at; the differing difficulties only providing more time for you to react to your foes. the game gives you many options for extracting fuel from your enemies, letting you create and lean into your own prefered playstyle - though pushing everyone to switch weapons and pull off stylish kills, with the reward of more leniency <br>these factors lead to ultrakill being an addicting shooter, where it feels like you're always getting better. however, the main thing that keeps <i>me</i> playing ultrakill is the movement! the physics of the game allow for incredibly fast movement - if you have percise timing. for example: if you hit control right as you hit the ground, you will maintain your speed into a slide after jumping! having to balance moving fast and being able to dodge is very challenging, but i enjoy that challenge a LOT. there are also a lot of unlocks - such as the rocket launcher and wiplash (which acts as a grappling hook) - that further increase your mobility.  <br>with just its gameplay, ultrakill makes it to evangelion tier. but thanks to its amazing soundtrack, interesting story, and its silly bullshit, ultrakill makes it to NITW tier :D"
