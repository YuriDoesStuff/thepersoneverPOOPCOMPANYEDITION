 <h1>things you can do in the hub!</h1>
 <p><strong>general hub-ness</strong>  
 <br>so! uh.
 <br>instead of having like a menu with the area select, piklopedia, treasure horde, and all of the other things you can do before you start your day, theres a hub with all of the castaways you save, and you can talk to each one! 
 <br>most of the rescue corps. members you save will allow you either access a new gameplay function, or will otherwise progress the story if nothing else
 <br>not all of the castaways have a function... but quite a few of them do! so uh. yeah :P
 <br>
 <br><strong>area select</strong>
 <br>so, there are two castaways that let you travel to locations! the comms guy, who lets you enter each area during daylight, and the doctor, who lets you go to night missions.
 <br>they do not do anything other than that
 <br>
 <br><strong>shops :)</strong>
 <br>both the Science Man and the Person in Charge of Dogs allow you to access new abilities or equipment for amounts of in-game numbers that can go down!
 <br>russ (the Science Man) allows you to access items like bomb rocks, and equipment (ala the explorer's kit in pikmin 2), for raw materials. sheppard (the Person in Charge of Dogs) allows you to upgrade oatchi for pup drive! such upgrades for oatchi include: 
<br> - charging faster
<br> - digging faster
<br> - being able to carry more
<br> - being able to swim
<br> - and. more. not much more, but more. 
<br> pup drive is earned by saving castaways, or curing leaflings
<br>
<br><strong>pikmin 2 area select things</strong>
<br>so um! you know the two non area select things in pikmin 2
<br>they both came back :D 
<br>theres this treasure appraiser, who rewards you for collecting treasures and lets you look at your treasure horde when you talk to him, and a Guy Who Loves Fauna, who rewards you for encountering creatures, and lets you look at the piklopedia when you talk to them
<br>bleh
<br>
<br><strong>side modes</strong>
<br>there are also a few castaways that let you participate in modes that have no bearing on the main game, outside of some raw materials as rewards
<br>theres corgwin, who lets you replay any dandori battles featured in the campaign, or play dandori battles localy, and jin, who lets you replay any of the dandori challenges!
<br>theres also a certan someone who lets you play a pikmin 1-inspired retread of all of the main areas, but. :)
<br>
<br><strong>side missions</strong>
<br>the most typical thing for a castaway to guide you to is a side mission. these can range from "ok build everything ever" to "bloom 300 pikmin flowers please! :D". when you complete a mission, you can gain 10-50 raw materials! which isnt a ton, but at least its something i guess
<br>
<br>you also gain access to an extremly challenging cave after you complete the game

<p><span>theres. so much new stuff.
<br>
<br><strong>oatchi!</strong> <img src=images/oatsmash.jpg width=200px style="float: right;">
<br>oatchi is your silly dog companion! i love him so much
<br>he can charge into enemies and walls, can do anything a pikmin can, can do anything a <i>purple</i> pikmin can (eventually), can swim over water, and can act like a second capitan kinda???
<br>he can also carry you and your pikmin and OH MY GOD THIS IS THE GREATEST THING HE CAN DO
<br>when your on him, theres just the passive benefit that NONE OF YOUR PIKMIN ON OATCHI CAN DIE. if oatchi is damaged, yes all the pikmin fall over and are vulnerable, but. you dont have to worry about your pikmin when just walking around. and thats just oh my god it makes me so less anxious
<br>security dog :P
<br>you also have the ability to jump when you are on him???? in a pikmin game???? which is so strange but neat 
<br>you can also charge while attached to him! once oatchi charges into an enemy, if any pikmin are attached to him they will hop off of oatchi and latch onto any part of the enemy they can.  
<br>
<br><strong>castaways</strong> <img src=images/castaway.jpg width=100px style="float: right;">
<br>so uh. you know all pikmin games have necessary collectables right
<br>in pikmin 1 it was ship parts, 2 has the globe treasures, and 3 has fruit
<br>pikmin 4 kinda has 2? kinda??? like you need to collect treasures to gain sparklum so you can continue to diffrent areas but. you also need to find castaways and leaflings (more on leaflings later) to actually complete the game
<br>you also get pup drive from saving castaways or leaflings, and from saving leaflings from their leafling-ness [more on pup drive later too :)]
<br>
<br><strong>flarlic</strong> <img src=images/flarlic.jpg width=150px style="float:right;">
<br>so uh. in pikmin 4, you start out by only being able to take out 20 pikmin at a time
<br>which is SO very lame i hate it so much
<br>but!!!!! but but but but but you can get FLARLIC
<br>theyre like onions. but garlic.
<br>and they let you take out 10 more pikmin once you transport them back to the onion
<br>unless you can already take out 100 pikmin then they just turn into sprays and stuff :/
<br>why this is here???? sighs
<br>
<br><strong>night days</strong>
<br>oh good god 
<br>night days are like these mission mode tower defense things???? 
<br>theyre the only places you can get glow pikmin, glow seeds (to spawn glowies in caves), and glow sap. glow sap allows you to cure leaflings from their leafyness, and grants one pup drive 
<br>to complete a night day, you need to either a: defeat all enemies, or b: defend all of the lumiknolls until daylight
<br>also, they take place in the same areas as the daytime days, and they take up an entire day... instead of being able to be played through after completing a day 
<br>
<br>during a night day, there are no onions! however, there are lumiknolls... theyre things that grow out of the ground that produce glow pikmin!!
<br>to sprout new glow pikmin, you need to take star bits from super mario galaxy and bring them back to the lumiknoll. of course by you, i mean your pikmin...
<br>you can also activate tricknolls, which can both trick enemies into attacking it, and can be used as another point for bringing back star bits... since you cant move where lumiknolls are located  
<br>glow pikmin can also be charged into a stun attack by holding x! once the big orb of glow pikmin hits an enemy or multiple enemies, they are stuned for a few seconds, then the glow pikmin divide themselves between the enemies. if there is just one enemy, all glow pikmin attack the singular enemy
<br>oh and also they teleport to whichever captain is active when idle, or when they are with an inactive captain :) 
<br>
<br>uh. after about a minute, enemies start to head towards the lumiknoll. then from there, its your job to juggle getting more glow pikmin and defending your base! blehg

<p><span>so!! theres ice pikmin and glow pikmin now :D
<br><img src=images/icepik.jpg width=150px> <img src=images/glowpik.jpg width=100px>
<br>
<br>ice pikmin are overpowered, thanks to the pikmin tradition of having to justify every new type by making them way more powerful then they need to be 
<br>when they attack enemies, they do minimal damage... but fill up an ice meter (thats visually right outside the enemy&apos;s health wheel). when filled, that enemy is basically hit with the ultra bitter spray from pikmin 2. for free. and if you have more than 20 ice pikmin on any enemy, they freeze... pretty much instantly! my god
<br>glow pikmin fall into the same boat as 2&apos;s whites and 3&apos;s rocks. or at least, they would be if they were an actual pikmin type...
<br>glow pikmin do not have an onion of any type. they are only found in the night missions... and can only exist in low-light environments. you can use them in caves with glow seeds (awarded from the night missions), but they can not come with you to the surface... 
<br>but! they can fly like pink pikmin, seem to have close to the same speed as white pikmin, have 1.0 attack power, and are immune to <i>everything</i>, like bulbmin in pikmin 2. so theyre still pretty good!! :D
