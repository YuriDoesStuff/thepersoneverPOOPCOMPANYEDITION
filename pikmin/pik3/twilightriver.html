<p><span>when you enter the twilight river, you'll be trying to find olimar... 
<br>theres 3 bridge piles you'll need to collect before you can get to the pink pikmin. sorry i meant flying pikmin 
<br>you'll need to use yellow pikmin for an eletric gate and a lightbulb, the latter of which will be used to activate bloominous flowers in a cave, and you'll need to bring rock pikmin, due to a pile of bridge pieces being inside of a crystal
<br>
<br>going through the only path with dry land, you will find a stream with lily pads! you can hop on these to transport your entire squad to the other side of the body of water :) 
<br>on the other side of the stream, you will find an electric gate, and a crystal with bridge pieces in it. behind the gate will be a wollywog, and a pile of bridge pieces. 
<br>further down the exposed path will be a puffy blowhog, a bomb rock repository, and a cave. the inside of the cave has no enemies within it, and houses a lightbulb that requires 20 yellow pikmin to activate. once activated, bloominous flowers will bloom, opening up the way to the final pile of bridge pieces 
<br>once over the fallen tree, which acts as a one way bridge, there is a UGH I FORGOT THE NAME. FLYING POKER, and a reinforced wall. pikmin <i>are</i> able to go through a path next to the wall, but will have to go back to the pile that they were assigned the long way if the wall is not destroyed
<br>also its generally not good practice to leave enemies along a trail where pikmin are carrying things. so you know. 
<br>
<br>good golly! i love fragments strewn across incredibly large areas!
