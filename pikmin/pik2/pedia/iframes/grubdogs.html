grub-dogs are the most geographically represented species on earth... most of them like to eat prey when said prey is returning to its nest at night, and are usually big in size.
<br>the dwarf bulborbs are NOT grub-dogs. they are breadbugs. dont believe everything your eyes tell you!

<p id=text>i don't CARE what the COLONIAL SASSACRE says, PURPLE PIKMIN are better than all of them <br> orange bulborbs are much quicker to wake, but can still be easily stunned with purple pikmin. hairy and red bulborbs are extremely similar, though! similar enough to where i can&apos;t find any gameplay differences between the two!</p>
