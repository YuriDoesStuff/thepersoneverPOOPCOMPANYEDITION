these cute little much-less-then-pint sized plant creatures are your key to survival on this hostile planet! they can ward off enemies, create more of themselves, carry various <i>things</i>, and even die i guess.
<br>
<br>each and every pikmin has their very own onion! purple and white onions aren't in this game though... mainly due to balancing, and possibly to continuing continuity. onions are a special place where defeated enemies can be carried back to, and turned into more pikmin! :D

<p id=text>red pikmin arent the greatest in this game... theyre able to destroy fire <em>things</em> without too much pain, and have 1.5x the attack damage that all other pikmin have (except for purples. they&apos;re insane). hazards are much less deadly in pikmin 2 than in the previous game though, due to having more control over your pikmin, the fact that fire takes 5 seconds to kill a pikmin now, and especially because you can destroy every elemetal hazard with any pikmin type. overall, i&apos;d say they&apos;re still useful, but are the least useful type of pikmin in pikmin 2.</p>
