<p id=text>these wollywogs are typically found in caves, and thus have a darker... flesh tone? than yellow wollywogs, and are stouter than their sunlight-eating cousins. wow okay <br> they hop up, then slam down in an attempt to kill your pikmin... you can throw pikmin on it until you're sure your pikmin wont make it onto the wog, and then wait till it&apos;s preparing to hit the ground before whistling. in pikmin one, the amount of pikmin they could crush was uncapped... in two however, they can only kill up to 5-6 pikmin at a time.</p>
