<br>
<br>
<p><span>the wistful wild is the 4th and final area of pikmin 2. there are no new pikmin types
<br>before everything. you should know that there's a gattling groink. it will head for your base. you need to kill it AND bring it back to an onion or else DEATH MURDER DESTRUCTION 
<br>when you exit the starting area, you'll come to a fork. on the right is a wall, a hermet crawmad, and some water. going to the left, you'll be greeted by a decorated cannon beetle. jesus crisps <!-- WHEN ARE WE LEAVING AMERICA. -d -->
<br>to the right of the cannon beetle, you will find the <a href=caves/cavernofchaos>cavern of chaos</a>. on top of the platform next to the cannon beetle, theres a few dwarf bulborbs, and a bridge on the other side of a lake. the lake has a few wollywogs...
<br>on the other side of the lake is a firey blowhog, and a cloaking burrow-nit. in the stump ahead, theres two orange bulborbs, and a puffy blowhog. greattt
<br>pushing through the stump, you will find the <a href=caves/dreamden>dream den</a>. glorious cave that dream den
<br>on a path next to the stump, and behind the poison wall near the dream den, is an area with like 3 creeping chrysanthemums... and in the very back of the map is the <a href=caves/holeofheroes>hole of heroes</a>... so you know the impact site from pikmin 1 
<br>uh... backtracking to spawn, you know the wall that was in the water? behind that is an area with 3 burdgeoning spiderwarts, a drain rock, and an electric gate protected by a cannon beetle larve. behind the electric gate is a shortcut to the hole of heroes! :D

<!--<br>..the final boss is in the dream den,, one of the caves in this area.. 
<br> my strategy for defeating him is 
<br> 
<br> 1: go through with a fairly ballanced team and get every treasure
<br> 2: DONT fight him with all your pikmin
<br> 3: go back with like 80 yellows and like 10 whites (the 10 whites are for the first subfloor)
<br> 4: throw all the whites outta the arena when you get to the final sublevel 
<br> 5: fight it for like. a half hour. yes it takes that long. if you use purples its like 20 minutes so like. yeah
<br> 6: pray you have enough pikmin by the end of it to pick every treasure up 
<br>
<br>..thats kinda it.. -->
