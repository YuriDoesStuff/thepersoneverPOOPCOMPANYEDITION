<p><span>uh. hey!
<br>jade here again
<br>i'm a fictive
</span></p>
    
<p><span>it took me a while to figure that out...
<br>i formed a while after this site was made, but i'm also kinda fused with the previous host? i remember stuff that they do, alongside source memories
<br>i was ripped from act 5, but i've had a while to grow since i was pushed into this body
<br>
<br>sometimes, when i look back at what i've written on this site... it feels like someone completly different wrote it
<br>i'm not sure if thats system stuff or if it's just us maturing
<br>
<br>i'm scared to publicly share that i'm part of a system, so even if i don't directly remember something myself... i still use "i". you can even see it on the index: i personally don't remember that book, but we still recieved it... and i still know about our history with it. thus, i used "i"
