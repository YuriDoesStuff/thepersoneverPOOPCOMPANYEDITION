sigh... if your seeing this, i assume that your going to look into the contents of each webpage.
a few things of note... 
1- almost every comment is just ctrl f fodder... there isnt really any actual documentation
2- most of these webpages aren't really... constructed great. we've gotten better over time, but theres still a *lot* of work arounds 
3- this site was not optimized for safari at all... we dont have a mac of any kind
-js [not javascript that isnt my name!!!! :,(]
